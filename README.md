DESCRIPTION

Problem Statement:

DigiComp is a global enterprise that, among other things, caters to designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing products like - clothing materials.

DigiComp has expanded its presence across the globe, and the business wants to get an in-depth analysis of its sales so as to make better sales decisions. So, DigiComp has decided to use Tableau Dashboards to consolidate the data from multiple sources, and carry out the sales analysis. This will help the sales department to access the data from remote locations that would increase the overall timeliness, find inefficiencies, and make better decisions.

As a Tableau developer, you are tasked with creating an interactive Sales Dashboard in Tableau for the Sales department to use it for ad-hoc analysis and reporting.
